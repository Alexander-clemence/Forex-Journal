## Setting Your Account Balance

### Why This Matters

2. **Enter Your Base Balance**
   - Enter your starting account balance (the amount you're trading with)
   - This should be your actual account balance before any trades
   - Example: If you have $10,000 in your trading account, enter `10000`

3. **Understanding Balance Types**
   - **Base Balance**: Your manually set starting balance
   - **Trade P&L**: Total profit/loss from all closed trades
   - **Current Balance**: Base Balance + Trade P&L (calculated automatically)

4. **Updating Your Balance**
   - If you deposit or withdraw funds, update your base balance
   - The system automatically adds your trade P&L to show your current balance
   - Click "Edit Balance" or the edit icon to update

### Example

- **Starting Balance**: $10,000 (you set this)
